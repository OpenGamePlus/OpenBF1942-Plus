# Debt, risks, open questions

| Item | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| RFA `unk` directory field | open question | constant per archive; meaning unknown |
| Patch archive override order | unverified | assumed `_NNN` archives override base files |
| `rfa.py extract` to disk on large archives | untested | full-install check was in-memory only |
| Pure-Python LZO speed | accepted debt | ~2 min for non-sound archives; fine for tools |
| `run` path resolution | open question | script-relative vs mod-root, see [con.md](../formats/con.md) |
| Networking protocol | risk | undocumented; roadmap step 8 |
